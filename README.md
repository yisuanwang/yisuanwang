👋 I am currently pursuing a **MPhil** degree in data science at **Tsinghua University**, with a research focus on **3D AIGC**.

🤖 I am currently working on research related to **LLM as Agent**, **2D/3D AIGC**, and **3D Avatar**, especially in areas that have a strong connection to humans. And would like to realize AGI for the benefit of humanity through generative AI.

🙋‍♂️ If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [yisuanwang AT gmail DOT com](mailto:yisuanwang AT gmail DOT com).

🎓 I graduated from **Harbin Engineering University with a B.S. degree in Software Engineering**, supervised by Prof. **[Chao Li](https://mohub.net/help/MoHub/UserServiceCases/Cases1.html#%E6%95%99%E5%B8%88%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D)**.
I had an internship at the **Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences**, supervised by Prof. **[Yubo Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=9z7GPxIAAAAJ)**.
In addition, I had a good time with Prof. **[Hao Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ygQznUQAAAAJ)** at **Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR), Tsinghua University**.

😥 I'll be **[emo](https://yisuanwang.github.io/emo)** on a regular basis, which looks to be caused by not being able to finish a paper.

🎉 There is some more interesting information on [my homepage](https://yisuanwang.github.io/) :)
