👋 I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in data science at Tsinghua University, with a research focus on 3D AIGC.

🤔 My research interests include large language models, large multimodal models, image, video, and 3D generative model. I very much enjoy LLM-related research because I think it is the best way to achieve AGI at this point in time. However, the main research work I will be doing in the next few years will be focused on 3D vision.

🤖 I am currently working on research related to LLM as Agent, 2D/3D AIGC, and 3D Avatar, especially in areas that have a strong connection to humans. And would like to realize AGI for the benefit of humanity through generative AI.
