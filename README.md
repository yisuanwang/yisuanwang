ðŸ‘‹ I am currently pursuing a MPhil degree in data science at Tsinghua University, with a research focus on 3D AIGC.

ðŸ¤” My research interests include LLM as Agent, 2D/3D AIGC, and Avatar, especially in areas that have a strong connection to humans. And would like to realize AGI for the benefit of humanity through generative AI.

ðŸ˜¥ I'll be [emo](https://yisuanwang.github.io/emo) on a regular basis, which looks to be caused by not being able to write a paper.
